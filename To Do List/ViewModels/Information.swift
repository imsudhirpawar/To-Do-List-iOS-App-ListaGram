STATE :-
 
@State is used to declare a property whose value can be modified within a view, and any changes to the value of the property will cause the view to be re-rendered.
 
 
 PUBLISHED :-
 
 @Published is used to declare a property whose value can be modified from outside of a view, such as from a ViewModel, and any changes to the value of the property will cause the view to be re-rendered.
 
 
 OBSERVABLEOBJECTS :-
 
 Observable Objects used to manage the state of your application and can be observed by any view that depends on them. When a property within an observable object changes, SwiftUI automatically re-renders any views that depend on that property, updating the view with the new value of the property. This makes it easy to create reactive, data-driven interfaces in SwiftUI.
